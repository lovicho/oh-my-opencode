// - The run cleans up after itself even when a test leaks: the whole root is removed.
// - Leaks are still caught: any entry left in the root that is not one of the preloads' own
//   directories fails the run, naming the leftover, so every test keeps removing what it creates.
//   Owners whose tests still leak are listed in test-temp-leak-report-only.json: their leftovers are
//   printed instead of failing, and that list may only shrink (script/check-temp-leak-report-only.mjs).
