## omo daemon reaches the launcher, the compiled entry and doctor

`omo daemon attach <launch args>` continues as a normal launch whose environment points the engine at
the shared socket. `omo doctor` gains one `INFO Daemon:` line (not running / pid, instance, engine,
sessions, zombies) - never a FAIL, since a machine without a daemon is healthy. The compiled binary
reaches the engine's host CLI by re-running ITSELF with `host ...` (an early command that goes to the
engine untouched); spawning a node path there would re-enter omo and leave a phantom session.

## omo daemon - the operator's view of the shared engine host

`omo daemon run|attach|status|stop|handoff` (`bin/lib/daemon.js`) wraps the engine's `senpi host`.
The wrapper owns three things and deliberately nothing else: the launch spec under the plugin root
is the argv source, `omo.json` `task.host_engine_policy` / `task.host_idle_exit_ms` is where the
policy comes from, and every outcome has a named exit code (2 usage, 3 not running, 4 win32,
5 the engine refused) so a script never parses prose. `run` and `attach` are omo's words for the
engine's `ensure`; `status` and `stop` do not need a launch spec and still work without one.

## 2026-09-17 — stamp the engine build epoch into compiled binaries

`build-info.ts` derives `EngineBuildStamp { scheme, epoch, sha7, source }` from omob
`OmoBuildInfo.engine` (commit + committedAt) or, for a release compile, from the pinned
`@code-yeongyu/senpi` package.json (`gitHead` plus `committedAt` / `gitCommittedAt` /
`gitHeadCommittedAt`). A missing timestamp is scheme `nodef` with epoch 0 — never `Date.now()`.

`compile-entry.ts` `versionLine` records which path the build took: omob `--version` includes
`+<epoch>.<sha7> (scheme epoch)`; a define-less release prints `scheme nodef`.

`script/engine-build-defines.ts` turns an epoch stamp into bun `--define SENPI_BUILD_EPOCH=…`
`--define SENPI_BUILD_SHA7="…"` and omits both for `nodef`. `script/build-omo-binary.ts` passes
those defines on every `bun build --compile` that has a stamp; `build-omob.ts` inherits them
through `--build-info`. Correctness of handoff does not depend on the define: a missing define
is scheme `nodef`, which per I2 never initiates a handoff.
