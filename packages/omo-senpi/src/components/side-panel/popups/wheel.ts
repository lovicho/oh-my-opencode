/**
 * Wheel events for the panel's viewers.
 *
 * The host routes a wheel event to whatever scroll view sits under the pointer in its layout,
 * and an overlay is composited separately rather than being part of that layout - so a wheel
 * over an open viewer scrolls the transcript behind it instead. The viewer therefore reads the
 * wheel itself, through the raw-input listener the host offers extensions, and claims the event
 * so nothing scrolls underneath.
 *
 * Only SGR reports are decoded: the alt-screen renderer enables mode 1006, so that is what
 * terminals send.
