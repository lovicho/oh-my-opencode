 * Clickable rows.
 *
 * The host already captures the mouse: pi-tui's alt-screen renderer turns SGR tracking on
 * unless a caller opts out, and senpi does not. What it does NOT offer is a per-component
 * mouse hook - it dispatches a click to the application exactly once, through OSC 8 hyperlink
 * activation: on a press and release inside one cell with no drag, it resolves a hyperlink
 * from its own rendered screen buffer and hands that URL to its `openUrl` callback.
 *
 * So a row becomes clickable by being painted as a hyperlink whose URL names the action, and
 * the panel recognises its own URLs by this private scheme. Because the hit test runs against
 * the host's buffer rather than the terminal's, a click works even where the terminal itself
 * does not implement OSC 8.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the host: the scheme is a string contract, which keeps it testable.
