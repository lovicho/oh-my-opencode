/**
 * Terminal safety for everything the panel paints.
 *
 * Row text carries strings the panel does not author: tool arguments, git paths (a valid file
 * name may hold a newline, BEL or ESC), task summaries, the goal objective, transcript and diff
 * lines. Written raw, an ESC can start a sequence the terminal executes, a BEL or ST can close the
 * row's own OSC 8 link early, and a newline breaks the column's one-row-per-line layout. Row text
 * never carries colour of its own - the theme paints `row.color` after this runs - so every C0 and
 * C1 control is removed, ESC included, and a file name cannot recolour the column either. Line
 * breaks and tabs become a space, so words on either side of them do not run together.
 * Bidi embedding, override and isolate marks go too: they make a name render in an order other
 * than the one it has, so `invoice\u202Etxt.exe` would read as a different file.
