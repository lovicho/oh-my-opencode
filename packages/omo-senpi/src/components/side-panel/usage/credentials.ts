 * Reads the engine's own credential files.

 * This component runs only inside Senpi, so OpenCode's data directory and `OPENCODE_AUTH_PATH`
 * do not apply here. The subscription credentials belong to Senpi's resolved agent directory.
 *
 * The host's generic key resolver normalises a credential and drops the per-account slots, and
 * those slots are exactly what decides which account is serving - so the files are the reliable
 * source here. They are re-read every poll rather than cached: tokens refresh and the pool fails
 * over between polls, and two small reads every couple of minutes cost nothing.
