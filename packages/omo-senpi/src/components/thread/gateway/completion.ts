 * Only an armed session reaches the store at all: every other settle - the ordinary case, with
 * nothing bound - costs no store call and never creates the gateway database.
 *
 * The durable `completion_arms` row is the source of truth, and the in-process arm stays until
 * the row's completion is written. A write that fails at the store's lock-wait bound is retried
 * in the background after the busy timeout, with the outcome of the run that settled, until it
 * lands. Each settled run is written with its own outcome, one write at a time per session: a run
 * that settles while an earlier run's write is outstanding waits behind it, and every write consumes
 * only the arms up to the newest `arm_seq` the session knew of when its run settled (`throughArmSeq`).
 * A later run's arm always has a higher sequence number, so a delayed or retried write never takes it
 * with the earlier outcome, even when both runs settle at the same clock reading.
